# GDD-Lite (Current Build)

## Vision

- Browser-based 2D top-down pixel RPG
- Post-fantasy ruins and techno-magical collapse
- Player role: Warden navigating memory-loss threat (Silt)

## Core Loop (Implemented Foundation)

1. Explore overworld sectors
2. Fight enemy packs or avoid them
3. Talk to faction NPCs
4. Start and complete quest objectives
5. Loot/craft resources and gain cinders
6. Level up and invest perk points
7. Unlock regions and repeat

## Narrative Pillars

- Archivists: restore memory and structure
- Pilgrims of Silt: accept forgetting and transformation
- Foundry Guild: pragmatic rebuilding via craft and trade
